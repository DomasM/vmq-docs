# Welcome

Welcome to the VerneMQ documentation! This is a reference guide for most of the available features and options of VerneMQ. The [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md) might be a good entry point.

For a more general overview on VerneMQ and MQTT, you might want to start with the [introduction](https://vernemq.com/intro/index.html).

For downloading the subscription-based binary VerneMQ packages and/or a quick description on how to compile VerneMQ from sources, see [Downloads](https://vernemq.com/downloads/index.html).
